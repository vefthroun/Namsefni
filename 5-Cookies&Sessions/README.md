### Sessions
- sessions in Flask are a way to store information about a specific user from one request to the next.
- sessions work by storing a cryptographically signed cookie on the users browser and decoding it on every request.
- The session object is NOT a secure way to store data. It's a base64 encoded string and can easily be decoded.
